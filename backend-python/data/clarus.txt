The product, the solution, the
innovation………

Blockchain, cryptocurrency, banking
industry and fiat currency is a mess.
Fiat currency is backed by nothing and
loses purchasing power year after year.
1 out of 4 people are “unbanked”.
Crypto/blockchain:
Confusing
Its risky and feels like gambling.
Where do I go for help?
It doesn’t seem to actually do anything to
improve my life or save me money.
Can anybody help me in cases of theft or
if I lose the password to my wallet?
Its slow, expensive to send and isn’t
backed by anything.

Nobody was addressing the
problems we saw in any
meaningful way, so we decided to
make something for ourselves.

It turns out that other people are
interested in our solution
too……therefore, welcome to

What is our “break-even” growth model?
We disrupt traditional banking and
financial services by positioning ourselves
as a replacement, while charging only
enough fees per year to cover expansion,
operating costs, and offset annual
inflation. This approach aligns with one of
our project aims: REAL MONEY.

A break-even business model that
traditional industries can only compete
with if they choose to return/negate

We aren’t just the
HOW but more
importantly we
are the WHY?

9/10 top cryptocurrencies
have a “If we build it, they will
come” mentality. They work
on faster, cheaper and more
secure but who cares if not
fixing real problems?

OUR VALUE COMES FROM BEING VALUABLE TO OTHERS.
Give them freedom. Give them savings.
Give them what they want, not what we want to give.
Make all this accessible and easy!
Don’t force the public to learn. Necessity and savings is enough. We have the
global market advantage NOW!

We are the only blockchain project with a people centered solution to make
cryptocurrency mainstream.

Our Brilliant Senior Team

Of special note:
*ONLY MYID utility coins are available for purchase now. OkGlobal Securities Coin offering is scheduled for 3rd or 4th quarter of 2025. As typical with
other securities offering, OkGlobal Securities Coin is a highly restricted sale. Terms and conditions of the securities offering will be made available at a
later date. SWITCH stable coins will be made available for purchase with the launch of our own unique blockchain(CLARUS) and consumer/merchant
payment wallet(MYID-WALLET) 2nd or 3rd quarter of 2024.
SWITCH stable coins are not an investment vehicle but a fiat backed stable payment bridge/currency necessary for merchants to avoid possible
price/value loss until OkGlobal Securities Coins build up a history to become a stable consistently growing hedge against inflation and absolute value
loss preferred by merchants.
SWITCH stable coins are intended for merchant use to avoid volatility but because they are backed by fiat currency, they are not a hedge against
inflation and are not asset backed, therefore have no guards against absolute loss!

We have First-Mover & Second Mover Advantage – No
comparable competition
Benefits of being a first-mover, second mover and market leader
Become a market leader, especially if there is no comparable competition.
Establish industry standards.
Develop a brand identity and brand recognition early on.
Secure a loyal customer base over a longer term than future competitors.
Lock in partnerships, contracts, and talent before any competitors do.

Develop new products and services, as well as tweak existing ones, over a longer time
frame.
Minimize acquisition costs, due to the lack of competition.
Capture investor attention, if the product, service, or company is seen as a
promising investment opportunity.

Disadvantages of being a first-mover (WE OVERCOME WITH 6 years of research,
development and real-life testing).
While it can be advantageous to be a first-mover, it isn’t necessarily a recipe for success. There
are also many disadvantages first-movers may encounter. This includes the risk of:
Paving the way for new companies to improve and expand upon the company’s existing products
or services.
Higher financial costs, given the need to establish a whole new market segment, among other
first-mover costs.
Being knocked back by regulators, as well as banks and investors, as they may be hesitant to
support an entirely new product, service, or company.
Failing to ‘keep up with the times’ if the company’s competitors are more successful with
innovating and responding to customers’ demands.
Not being able to learn from the successes and failures of competitors, while competitors are
able to do so with your company — even before they launch.
Being perceived by consumers as passé once newer, more advanced options become available.
Being scrutinized more acutely due to having a first-mover status.

Real-life examples of companies with first-mover advantage:
The following are examples of well-known companies that are
said to have benefited from first-mover advantage:
Amazon — The first significant online bookstore.
Tesla — The first company that successfully pioneered electric
vehicles.
eBay — The first major online auction website.
We take advantage of being both a first mover and a second
mover!

• Listing of MYID Coins and marketing on own SWITCH exchange.

MY IDENTITY COIN
AVAILABILITY IN 2024:

-Launch of Blockchain Banking Solutions Centers(BBSC) around the world(Blockchain Cities). BBSCs are a powerful
marketing/branding advantage and public on-boarding bridge that no other project has capitalized upon:
-Viral growth strategy for MYIDverified wallets to collect fees from children(MYIDanonymous) wallets.
-Our BBSCs offer money savings services that people already use. We require a minimum MYID purchase of $5 USD to enjoy
the benefits. The average purchase during a beta test at our USA and Singapore BBSCs has been upwards of over $50/person.
We offer a win/win situation. The consumer wins by getting coins that may increase in value and the consumer saves money
immediately on services he/she would have used anyways. We begin by offering money changing services free/at-cost.
MYID coin sales generated at BBSCs are used to “buy-back” our own coins on exchanges, after paying for necessary operation
costs. Thereby we increase liquidity and an organic upward price drive of MYID Coins.
-Traditional boots on the ground marketing at our global locations.
-MY IDENTITY Coins are required for the transmission fee(gas) to be applied when utilizing the MYIDverified-Wallet crypto
protection guard.
-Easiest on-boarding process in the world. OUR STAFF does the work for the public. This is a necessity for a large percentage
of the general population who are intimidated, had no real financial incentive and/or uneducated about the process.

BANKING FOR THE “UN-BANKED” : Create non-id accounts for the un-banked and who MAY wish to stay anonymous. MYID is
an optional identification technology that can be used for its utility purpose or can be used as a value speculation instrument.
(Re-sale at profit.)
• Social media influencers via YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, twitter, etc..

• Roadshows/conferences and promotion of blockchain basics education courses leading to the sales of MYID coins to
attendees.
• Traditional print, billboard, tv and radio outreach/marketing.
• Beta testing with merchants and consumers in El Salvador and USA-Mexico in the economic development zone outlined by
our project and colleagues at the “Border Fusion Initiative”. We will be well positioned to expand and market our project
globally while making a cross border impact on many people who truly would benefit from our project the most, the under
privileged and often with the least opportunities in our society.

Proof – of – Stake node Grants for transaction verification rewarded with
income/fee generation.
One grant will be shared by our El Salvador investment participants for the
purpose of transaction validating a cap equivalent to $25 million USD/day. This
grant is awarded directly from CLARUS Money Project. The staked coins are
owned by CLARUS Money Project and are for the sole purpose of El Salvador
investment participants to generate an income/fee revenue to be shared
amongst the investor participants.
Staking Coins:

Staking involves locking a certain amount of cryptocurrency in a unique wallet to
earn rewards. Here’s how it works:
Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains use staking as a consensus mechanism.
Stakers are randomly selected to secure, validate, and produce blocks on the
blockchain network.
In return for their participation, stakers receive interest/fees.
By staking their coins, users actively contribute to network security and stability.
Collecting Fees from Verifying Transactions:
Validators play a crucial role in validating transactions on PoS blockchains.
Unlike traditional hardware-based validators, PoS validators prove their honesty
by staking coins.
Here’s how it works:
Staking: Validators lock up a certain amount of cryptocurrency (their stake) as
collateral.
Transaction Verification: Validators verify and validate transactions on the
blockchain.
Rewards: After successfully verifying transactions, validators are rewarded.
These rewards can come in the form of transaction fees or similar incentives.
The fees compensate validators for their efforts and costs associated with
running staking pools.
In summary, staking allows crypto holders to actively participate in network
security, while earning rewards by verifying transactions. It’s a win-win for both
the network and investors.
